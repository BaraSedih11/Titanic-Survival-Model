This repository contains an implementation of Titanic Survival Model with decision trees in python.

## Overview

In this repository, we demonstrate how to perform decision trees and data manipulation using Python to predict a Titanic survival model. We utilize libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn to implement and visualize the decision trees model. Additionally, we provide a simple example along with explanations to help you understand how to apply decision trees to your own datasets.

## Requirements

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn 

```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaraSedih11/Titanic-Survival-Model.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd Titanic
```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Follow along with the code and comments in the notebook to understand how decision trees is implemented using Python.
